Version 0.0.1


    Moved Information Displays To Upper PFD

    Changed Wind Overlay. It now takes up less screen real estate and the color should pop a bit more.
    Resized & re-positioned the following elements

        Requested Altitude
        Current Altitude
        Requested VS
        Current VS
        Barometer
        Requested Speed
        IAS
        TAS
        Ref Speeds
        Inset Map -- This sits inside of the elevation window now, I think it aids situational awareness
